**Showcasing various design patterns implemented in Java - Spring-Boot.**

This collection serves as a practical guide and reference for developers aiming to understand and apply design patterns effectively in their projects.

**Design Patterns Included**

**Adapter Pattern:**
Helps incompatible interfaces work together by wrapping an existing class with a new interface.

**Command Pattern:**
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

**Decorator Pattern:**
Allows behavior to be added to an individual object dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

**State Pattern:**
Illustrates how an object can change its behavior when its internal state changes.

**Purpose**

**This repository aims to:**

Provide clear and concise examples of commonly used design patterns.
